        <h2>01 Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Vietnamese Breakfast is a cooking simulation that immerses players in the process of preparing a traditional Vietnamese breakfast. 
          The gameplay focuses on two main tasks: brewing a hot cup of coffee and making Vietnamese bread.
           Players will interact with household items by dragging and clicking to complete each step by provided step-by-step instructions.</p>

          <h2>02 Ideation and Branstorming</h2>
          <p>The concept for this interactive simulation game centers around preparing a traditional and iconic Vietnamese breakfast, featuring “banh mi” and a hot cup of coffee.
             As I was born and raised in Vietnam, these dishes have been an essential part of my mornings, making them a meaningful choice for this project.</p>

          <h2>03 Illustration</h2>
          <p>The illustration focuses on vibrant, hand-drawn visuals that bring Vietnamese culture to life.
             Key elements include detailed portrayals of traditional kitchen tools, and ingredients with a peaceful setting, illustrating the authentic Vietnamese breakfast culture.
             The primary combination of yellow, red, and orange represents the warm tone, giving a sense of nostalgia</p>

          <h2>04 Programming Development</h2>
          <p>The coding aspect focuses on creating interactive features between the program and users.
             Java manages gameplay mechanics, including step-by-step recipes, minor animations, and sound effects to enhance realism.
             For example, dragging a cup triggers a placement sound, controlled by a Finite State Machine (FSM) which is a programming model that manages game stages and transitions.</p>

          <h2>05 Usability Testing and Iterations</h2>
          <p>This session focuses on improving the game’s usability to ensure smooth interactions.
             Addressing bugs in ingredient collisions with household items required excessive testing and fixes.
              Iterations refined visuals and added guiding elements, such as a text box to enhance user flow.
             Iterations ensure the game accurately represents Vietnamese culture while providing a seamless user experience.</p>

          <h2>06 Reflection</h2>
          <p>Developing Vietnamese Breakfast was a meaningful experience, reflecting my connection to traditional Vietnamese food.
             A key challenge was collision detection, especially for precise button clicks. Implementing a bounding box improved accuracy, enhancing user experience. 
            This project deepened my understanding of game mechanics and interaction design.</p>
